        ckpt_dir (str): The directory containing checkpoint files for the pretrained model.
        tokenizer_path (str): The path to the tokenizer model used for text encoding/decoding.
        temperature (float, optional): The temperature value for controlling randomness in generation.
            Defaults to 0.6.
        top_p (float, optional): The top-p sampling parameter for controlling diversity in generation.
            Defaults to 0.9.
        max_seq_len (int, optional): The maximum sequence length for input prompts. Defaults to 512.
        max_batch_size (int, optional): The maximum batch size for generating sequences. Defaults to 8.
        max_gen_len (int, optional): The maximum length of generated sequences. If None, it will be
